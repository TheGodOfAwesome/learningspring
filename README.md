A demo Spring Web project 

When creating a new project it’s probably a good idea to add web, lombok and security using Spring Initializr https://start.spring.io/
- After generating the demo project and download.
- Extract files to your project folder (if you are using CVS this would be a good moment to add the files to your clone empty repo folder).
- Open Intellij Idea
- Go to File
- Select New 
- Select Project From Existing Sources
- Select maven if that’s the build automation tool you are using
- And follow the the config steps only adding options that you need or removing options that you don’t need.
- Wait for the the project to generate you source files and presto congrats you now have your first Spring Boot Project
